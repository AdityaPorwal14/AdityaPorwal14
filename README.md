### Hi Developers! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m [**Aditya**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adityaporwal14/), a a Computer Science engineering student and full-time learner based in Jaipur, India.

Outside of code and debugging sessions, you’ll find me exploring self-improvement books like *Atomic Habits*, cycling around peaceful spots, or playing carrom with friends. I also enjoy creating content on LinkedIn about tech.

Passionate about solving problems, learning new things, and growing 1% every day.<br>

- ⚙️ I use daily: `.cpp`, `.sql`, `.html`, `.css`, `.js`, `.psd`
- 🌱 Currently focused on building strong foundations in **DSA** and **Core Concepts**
- 💬 `ping` me about **problem-solving**, **tech learning**, **design**, **productivity hacks**!
- 🧠 I believe in: "Small habits. Big results."
- 📚 Love reading books like *Atomic Habits* & exploring how to live better, not just code better.
